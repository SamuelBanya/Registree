# Registree
A prototype of a React + .NET (C#) based app that allows users to create gift registry lists for all occasions to easily share among friends and family!

Note:

Though this project was not finished, here is what I learned:
- I applied the same mentality to that project as I did with my actual job by creating separate feature branches for new ideas, and merged the related PRs into 'main' when they were appropriately complete.
- I got my Spacemacs config up to par with most of the React / Typescript side of the project itself along with Prettier, though it could be better for the C# backend I was attempting to add.
- I learned to stop taking on full stack apps without a team --> There is a reason why my actual job has a team for frontend and backend separately.
- An idea is great but if you can't accomplish it within about 2 weeks to a month tops, it is probably too big for one person, and you will lose interest fast --> I learned this in the past with an application I created years ago that involved the Express 7 train in NYC which took months to complete only to realize that the design was HEAVILY flawed in terms of the output data I expected to receive.

I am thankful that I did my best for this project, and honestly, the Figma template and actual design is close, so I am proud of that in that respect.
